        Flowers are an essential part of our lives.<br> They are responsible for bringing happiness in our lives and making our surrounding environment a prettier place to live in. <br> Thus, we must all plant flowers at homes and in our neighbourhood to beautify the place and bring happiness and joy for everyone passing by.
